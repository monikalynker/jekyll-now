title: A Pattern: Well Defined Goals
---


###### Problem: Goals are often not defined, illdefined, or become so over time.

As complex systems grow and evolve, we often lose sight of the purpose for which they were brought into existence. Somtimes these systems, inadvertantly start moving in directions that are orthogonal to, and sometimes opposed to, their original purpose.

What is the goal of a country? Is it not the happiness and prosperity of its people? Then what of the countries that result in misery for their people?

###### Example: Healthcare.
Often the original (and sometimes stated) goal of healthcare regulation is to an increase in health and welfare, but often the regulatory regime ends up working towards other ends, like fairness, acess, and costs. These are worthy goals. Intuitively they are even related (in some fashion) to the original purpose of regulation, but are they in perfect alignment with that purpose. Perhaps not.

The problem is that unless we continue to be vigilant that the overall goals are well-defined we can easily lose sight of them and drift. Several other patterns can help us overcome some of the obstacles as we do this. See **Measurable Goals**, **Dyanamic Goals**, and **Comprehensive Goals**.
