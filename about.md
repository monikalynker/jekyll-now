Steve Byers is an interdependent consultant who works with leaders, leadership teams, and their organizations, helping these human systems think, learn, and work together - better. He can help when a change is needed and desired, but something in the system resists changing. Resistance might be due to deep beliefs and assumptions that work against the desired change. Or, resistance might be generated by existing system structures - policies, relationships, information flows - that continue to reinforce old behavior patterns. Resistance can also arise, despite best intentions, because of unexamined commitments that frustrate efforts to change.

In collaboration with Actuarial Analytics, Steve helps leaders and their teams have the difficult conversations about the challenges of changing how they do business. In these conversations he draws on his experience in systems thinking, mutual learning, and adaptive leadership to invite reflection, cultivate awareness and insights, and support wise action. These conversations can take place in a retreat setting, or over a period of time within the flow of day to day activities.
